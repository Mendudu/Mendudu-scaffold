# Mendudu-scaffold
Mendudu Scaffold is a CLI tool to scaffold fullstack web application (React frontend, Lua backend with Mendudu + LuaSQL)

# Idea  
We are doing a CLI tool to scaffold fullstack fullstack web application in just one simple command.

1) Creates React (Vite) frontend.
2) Creates a server (Mendudu) with setup for routing.
3) Choose LuaSQL driver:
luasql-sqlite3
luasql-postgres
luasql-mysql
luasql-sqlite
luasql-odbc

And it will inject the correct driver (your db choice) and setup in the server project.

4) Web application is setup and ready to use. You now have a frontend project (React) with backend (Mendudu) and LuaSQL driver to connect to database.
This is a fullstack example project to get started in just a few minutes instead of setting up all by yourself. 

## This is in the workings and will be announced at our LinkedIn and on our homepage (https://mendudu.com) so keep yourself updated. You can also join our Discord to keep yourself updated link on homepage.
